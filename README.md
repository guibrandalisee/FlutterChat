# Flutter Chat APP

***This is a realtime chat app made using Flutter/Dart and Firebase***

**This is one of my firt projects using Flutter**

**This app was made following an udemy tutorial**

**I made this app to learn how to use flutter, so don't expect much**

The app only has one general chat and does not support direct messages

Why doesn't it support direct messages? As I said I made this app to learn Flutter

This app is quite old, so, somethings may not work with newer versions of packages used

**For the app to work you have to add your own google-services.json**

find out how to do it **[here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)**

**Since the app uses the Google login feature, you must have an SHA-1 certificate when adding the application to Firebase**
