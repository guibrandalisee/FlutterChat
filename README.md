# Flutter Chat APP

***This is a realtime chat app made using Flutter/Dart and Firebase***

**This is one of my firts projects using Flutter**

**I made this app to learn how to use flutter, so don't expect much**

The app only has one general chat and does not support direct messages

Why doesn't it support direct messages? As I said I made this app to learn Flutter

This app is quite old, so, somethings may not work with newer versions of plugins used

For the app to work you have to add your own google-services.json

find out how to do it **[here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)**
